This is the true story
of 21 strangers
picked to code together
and have their lives taped
to find out what happens when people stop being polite
because Nick quotes too many movies.

Hey All,
Please put all your ideas here!!  They will be discussed Sunday at 2pm at DBC over some type of delicious lunch I will coordinate.

Ideas:
- everyone talk like Sherif throughout the video. 
- bunch of mini skits about the idiosyncrasies of DBC (long men's bathroom lines, the way Sherif talks, jenga, the androids, these videos, butt-rubbing, etc)
- phase 3 project pitch and production of the most outrageous idea ever (don't know what that is - maybe an entirely new Internet based on communicating via letters spelled from people's bodies (google body letters to see what I mean) or a web site used to schedule someone to come slap you with a herring)
